## Device Owner Setup Guide

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

Use our automated setup scripts:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
npm run setup-device-owner

# Windows
npm run setup-device-owner-windows
```

These scripts will guide you through the entire process automatically!

### Method 1: Using ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

#### Prerequisites

- Device must be factory reset or never had a user account added
- USB debugging must be enabled
- ADB must be installed on your computer

#### Steps

1. **Factory reset the device** (if not already done)

   ```bash
   # Optional: Reset via ADB
   adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR
   ```

2. **Skip the setup wizard** without adding any accounts
   - Do not sign in to Google account
   - Do not add any user accounts

3. **Enable Developer Options**
   - Go to Settings > About phone
   - Tap "Build number" 7 times
   - Go back to Settings > Developer options
   - Enable "USB debugging"

4. **Connect device to computer and verify ADB connection**

   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```

5. **Set your app as Device Owner**

   ```bash
   # Replace com.yourcompany.yourapp with your actual package name
   adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.yourcompany.yourapp/.DeviceAdminReceiver
   ```

6. **Verify Device Owner status**
   ```bash
   adb shell dpm list-owners
   ```

#### Example Commands for This Library

```bash
# For the example app
adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.kioskmanager.example/.DeviceAdminReceiver

# For your production app (replace with your package name)
adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.yourcompany.yourapp/.DeviceAdminReceiver
```

### Method 2: Using MDM (Mobile Device Management)

#### Enterprise Solutions

- **Google Workspace Admin Console**
- **Microsoft Intune**
- **VMware Workspace ONE**
- **Samsung Knox**
- **Custom EMM solutions**

#### General MDM Setup Process

1. **Enroll device in MDM**
   - Factory reset the device
   - During setup, scan QR code or enter enrollment details
   - Device will be provisioned as managed device

2. **Configure Device Owner via MDM**
   - Set your app as the device owner through MDM console
   - Deploy the app via MDM
   - Configure kiosk policies

3. **Benefits of MDM approach**
   - Remote management
   - Bulk deployment
   - Policy enforcement
   - Remote wipe capabilities

### Method 3: Using Android Enterprise (Zero-Touch)

#### For Large Scale Deployments

1. **Register with Android Enterprise**
   - Sign up for Android Enterprise
   - Configure zero-touch enrollment

2. **Device Configuration**
   - Devices are automatically enrolled when first powered on
   - Your app is automatically set as device owner
   - No manual setup required

### Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Requirements:**

- Device must be in factory reset state
- No user accounts can be added before setting device owner
- Once device owner is set, it cannot be changed without factory reset
- Device owner has extensive system privileges

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Considerations:**

- Device owner has full device control
- Can install/uninstall apps silently
- Can modify system settings
- Can wipe device remotely

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **"Not allowed to set the device owner"**
   - Solution: Factory reset and try again without adding accounts

2. **"Device owner is already set"**
   - Solution: Clear existing device owner first

   ```bash
   adb shell dpm remove-active-admin com.existing.package/.AdminReceiver
   ```

3. **"User is not empty"**
   - Solution: Remove all user accounts and try again

4. **ADB not recognized**
   - Solution: Install Android SDK Platform Tools
   - Add ADB to system PATH

#### Verification Commands

```bash
# Check current device owner
adb shell dpm list-owners

# Check if device is provisioned
adb shell getprop ro.setupwizard.mode

# List all device admin receivers
adb shell pm list packages -a | grep admin
```

### Development vs Production

#### Development

- Use ADB method for testing
- Easy to reset and reconfigure
- Good for debugging

#### Production

- Use MDM or Zero-Touch enrollment
- Scalable for multiple devices
- Professional device management
